Q1：p32-> Supports external wait signals to expand the bus cycle.
	How to expand the bus cycle?
	
Q2: p33-> In UART-> Supports IrDA 1.0
	What's IrDA 1.0，红外功能如何实现?

Q3：p50-> In SDRAM/SRAM, nBE[3:0] O Upper byte/lower byte enable (In case of 16-bit SRAM)
	what does it mean?

Q4：如何确定机器的little or big endian?


Q5: p80-> FIQ is externally generated by taking the nFIQ input LOW. This input can except either synchronous or
	   	  asynchronous transitions, depending on the state of the ISYNC input signal. When ISYNC is LOW, nFIQ and nIRQ
		  are considered asynchronous, and a cycle delay for synchronization is incurred before the interrupt can affect the
		  processor flow.
